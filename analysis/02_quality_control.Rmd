Introduction
============

In this document we are produce a high quality dataset for analysis and
reporting. This will include things like removing incorrect values, making new
columns and combining responses.

    `What can we do for you?`                         = col_character()
)

responses <- read_csv(here("data", "responses_raw.csv"), col_types = col_types)
```

Age
===

When we plotted age we saw one value over 250. This is obviously not a real
response. Let's have a look at all the values for this response and try and work
out if the whole thing is incorrect or somebody has just made a typo in one
field.

```{r age}
responses %>%
    filter(Age > 250) %>%
    glimpse()
```

There are a few things that make it seem like this is not a real response,
particularly that they have responed "No" to both having a coursework component
and having a research component. Given this let's remove this response.

```{r age-filter}
responses <- responses %>%
    filter(Age < 250)
```

The distribution of ages now looks like this:

```{r age-plot}
ggplot(responses, aes(x = 1, y = Age)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Just to be sure let's check if there are any other responses that answered "No"
to both the research and coursework questions.

```{r check-no}
responses %>%
    filter(responses$`Coursework component?` == "No",
           responses$`Research component?` == "No") %>%
    glimpse()
```

It looks like there is one more of these responses. Because most of the
questions are in these sections, and all students should be doing at least one
of coursework and research, this response is probably not informative so we can
remove it as well.

```{r check-no-filter}
responses <- responses %>%
    filter(responses$`Coursework component?` != "No" |
           responses$`Research component?` != "No")
```

Academic background
===================

Respondents were asked what their academic background was and given the options
"Biology", "Computer science/software engineering", "Statistics/Mathematics" or
"Other". Let's look at what they said.

```{r background responses}
table(responses$`Academic background`)
```

Most of these other responses appear only once so let's group them into the
following groups:

* Biology - Biology, Biology but did a MSc(bioinformatics), Microbiology
* Computer science/software engineering - Computer science/software engineering,
  originally doing BE (software)/BSc (maths) but now BE (software)/BSc
  (genetics) with a bioinformatics focus
* Statistics/Mathematics - Statistics/Mathematics
* Other - Bioinformtics, Biomedical Computing (bio &comp), Biotech, Clinical,
  Honours in Biomedical Computing, Pharmacy, Psychology, Bioengineering (Minors
  in mathematics and cell bio), Chemical Engineering, chemistry engineering,
  Mechanical Engineering

```{r group-background}
responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(BackgroundGrouped = `Academic background`) %>%
    mutate(BackgroundGrouped = recode(BackgroundGrouped,
        `Biology but did a MSc(bioinformatics)` = "Biology",
        Microbiology = "Biology",
        `originally doing BE (software)/BSc (maths) but now BE (software)/BSc (genetics) with a bioinformatics focus` = "Computer science/software engineering",
        `Bioengineering (Minors in mathematics and cell bio)` = "Other",
        `Chemical Engineering` = "Other",
        `chemistry engineering` = "Other",
        `Mechanical Engineering` = "Other",
        `Bioinformtics` = "Other",
        `Biomedical Computing (bio &comp)` = "Other",
        Biotech = "Other",
        Clinical = "Other",
        `Honours in Biomedical Computing` = "Other",
        Pharmacy = "Other",
        Psychology = "Other"
    ))
```

Let's see what these groups look like.

```{r plot-background-grouped}
ggplot(responses, aes(x = BackgroundGrouped)) +
    geom_bar()
```

Finances
========

When a question allows respondents to select multiple check boxes Google Sheets
combines the answer into a single string. This is not very useful for analysis,
what we really want is a TRUE/FALSE for each option.

```{r add_options_cols}
add_options_cols <- function(responses, col, opts) {
    options_list <- map(responses[[col]], function(response) {
        choices <- unlist(str_split(response, ", "))
        selected <- opts %in% choices
        others <- choices[!(choices %in% opts)]
        is_other <- length(others) > 0
        other <- paste(others, collapse = ", ")
        c(selected, is_other, other)
    })

    options_df <- options_list %>%
        do.call(rbind, .) %>%
        as_data_frame() %>%
        setNames(c(opts, "IsOther", "Other")) %>%
        mutate_at(1:(length(opts) + 1), as.logical) %>%
        mutate(Other = if_else(Other == "", NA_character_, Other)) %>%
        rename_all(function(x) {paste0(col, " [", x, "]")})
    
    responses <- bind_cols(responses, options_df)
    
    return(responses)
}
```

```{r tidy-finances}
opts <- c("Government scholarship (e.g. RTP)",
          "University scholarship (RTP equivalent)",
          "Top-up scholarship",
          "Part-time work",
          "Full-time work",
          "Parental support",
          "Savings")

responses <- add_options_cols(responses, "Finances", opts)
```

```{r plot-finances}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("Finances [")) %>%
    select(-`Finances [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Received) %>%
    filter(Received == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "Finances \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

This also makes it easier to look at the "Other" responses.

```{r finances-other}
responses %>%
    filter(`Finances [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Finances [Other]`)
```

There are two identical responses here. It seems likely that this is a duplicate
entry but let's just check across all the fields.

```{r finances-duplicate}
responses %>%
    filter(`Finances [Other]` == "nothing, I am piss poor") %>%
    glimpse()
```

All of the responses seem the same so we will remove the second of these
entries.

```{r finances-filter}
to_drop <- which(responses$`Finances [Other]` == "nothing, I am piss poor")[2]
responses <- responses[-to_drop, ]
```

Classes
=======

```{r coursework}
coursework <- responses %>%
    filter(`Coursework component?` == "Yes")
```

When we look at the exploratory classes plot there are some values between 0 and
1. People were asked how many classes they are enrolled in this semester so it
should be a whole number. Let's see what they put, there might also be some
clues in their response to coursework details question.

```{r classes}
coursework %>%
    filter(Classes < 1) %>%
    glimpse()

coursework %>%
    filter(Classes < 1) %>%
    pull(`Coursework details`)
```

It looks like this person has some compulsory coursework but isn't currently
enrolled in any classes. Most of the rest of the coursework questions ask about
study load this semester. Their responses to these probably aren't relevant so
let's make a new column that tells us if people are currently doing coursework.

```{r classes-set}
responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(CourseworkCurrent = if_else(`Coursework component?` == "Yes" &
                                           Classes < 1,
                                       "No", `Coursework component?`))

coursework <- responses %>%
    filter(CourseworkCurrent == "Yes")
```

The questions about different types of classes ask for a percentage but there
are a few very low values. This suggests that some people didn't quite
understand what the question was asking for. For the moment we will leave these
as they are.

Research
========

```{r research}
research <- responses %>%
    filter(`Research component?` == "Yes")
```

Some people who said they had a research component to their course said that
zero percent of their time was spent doing research. Let's have a look at those
more closely.

```{r research-zero}
research %>%
    filter(`Research percentage` == 0) %>%
    glimpse()
```

It look like this person is doing a PhD and spends 100 percent of their time
doing research but set the percentage of their course as research to zero. This
seems like a mistake so let's set it 100.

```{r research-percent-set}
responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(`Research percentage` = if_else(`Research percentage` == 0,
                                           100L, `Research percentage`))
```

Other people did something similar with the research time question. Let's have a
look at them.

```{r research-time}
research %>%
    filter(`Research time` == 0) %>%
    glimpse()

research %>%
    filter(`Research time` == 0) %>%
    pull(`Research details`)
```

Two of these people say they haven't started their research yet. It seems likely
that is true of the third as well so let's make a new column to tell us if
people are currently doing research.

```{r research-time-set}
responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(ResearchCurrent = if_else(`Research component?` == "Yes" &
                                         `Research time` == 0, "No",
                                     `Research component?`))

research <- responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes")
```

Research focus
==============

Similar to the Finances question the research focus question let people tick
multiple checkboxes. Let's convert the options to columns like we did before.

```{r tidy-focus}
opts <- c("Genomic variants",
          "Gene expression",
          "Metagenomics",
          "Proteomics",
          "Data visualisation",
          "Methods development",
          "Cancer",
          "Data analysis",
          "Cell biology",
          "Plant biology",
          "Rare disease",
          "Metabolomics",
          "Microbial biology",
          "Human biology",
          "Model organisms",
          "Non-model organisms")

responses <- add_options_cols(responses, "Research focus", opts)
```

```{r plot-focus}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("Research focus [")) %>%
    select(-`Research focus [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Studied) %>%
    filter(Studied == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "Research focus \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

This also makes it easier to look at the "Other" responses.

```{r focus-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Research focus [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Research focus [Other]`)
```

There is one person here who has answered "Unsure yet" to many of the research
questions. It looks like they are another person that hasn't started their
research project yet. Let's set `ResearchCurrent` to "No" for them as well.

```{r research-focus-set}
responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(ResearchCurrent = if_else(
        is.na(`Research focus [Other]`),
        ResearchCurrent, if_else(
            `Research focus [Other]` == "Unsure yet",
            "No", ResearchCurrent)))

research <- responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes")
```

Technologies and platforms
==========================

This is another multi-choice question. Let's turn it into columns.

```{r tidy-techs}
opts <- c("RNA-seq",
          "Whole genome sequencing",
          "Exome sequencing",
          "Short read sequencing (e.g. Illumina)",
          "Long read sequencing (e.g. MinIon PacBio)",
          "Mass spectrometry",
          "Array-based technologies (eg. expression microarrays)",
          "Flow cyometry")

responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(Technologies = str_replace(`Experimental technologies and platforms`,
                                     "MinIon, PacBio", "MinIon PacBio")) %>%
    add_options_cols("Technologies", opts)
```

```{r plot-techs}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("Technologies [")) %>%
    select(-`Technologies [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Used) %>%
    filter(Used == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "Technologies \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

```{r techs-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Technologies [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Technologies [Other]`)
```

Programming
===========

The programming question is another multi-choice question.

```{r tidy-programming}
opts <- c("R",
          "Python",
          "Shell",
          "Git",
          "Perl",
          "C/C++",
          "MATLAB")

responses <- responses %>%
    add_options_cols("Programming languages", opts)
```

```{r plot-programming}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("Programming languages [")) %>%
    select(-`Programming languages [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Used) %>%
    filter(Used == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "Programming languages \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

```{r programming-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Programming languages [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Programming languages [Other]`)
```

Collaboration
=============

Another multi-choice question

```{r tidy-collaboration}
opts <- c("Your research group",
          "Other research groups (at your institute/university)",
          "External research groups",

```

```{r other-support-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Other support [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Other support [Other]`)
```

COMBINE Familiarity
===================

Another multi-choice question.

```{r tidy-combine-familiarity}
opts <- c("This survey",
          "Follow COMBINE on social media",
          "Subscribe to COMBINE mailing list",
          "Attended COMBINE workshop",
          "Attended COMBINE seminar",

    filter(`Familiarity with COMBINE [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Familiarity with COMBINE [Other]`)
```

ABACBS Familiarity
===================

Another multi-choice question. First let's fix the typo in it.

```{r abacbs-familiarity-typo}
responses <- responses %>%
    rename(`Familiarity with ABACBS` = `Familiarity with the ABACBS`)
```


```{r tidy-abacbs-familiarity}

          "I haven't had any involvement with ABACBS")

responses <- responses %>%
    add_options_cols("Familiarity with ABACBS", opts)
```

```{r plot-abacbs-familiarity}

```{r abacbs-familiarity-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Familiarity with ABACBS [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Familiarity with ABACBS [Other]`)
```

ABACBS membership
===================

Another multi-choice question.

```{r tidy-abacbs-membership}
opts <- c("Member of a national society",
          "Discounts for ABACBS/COMBINE events",
          "Discounts for ABACBS conference/COMBINE Symposium",

          "Access to ABACBS prizes and awards",
          "Looks good on a CV",
          "A say in the direction of the society",
          "I don't think there are any benefits of membership for students")

responses <- responses %>%
    add_options_cols("ABACBS Membership", opts)
```

```{r plot-abacbs-membership}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("ABACBS Membership [")) %>%
    select(-`ABACBS Membership [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Used) %>%
    filter(Used == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "ABACBS Membership \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

```{r abacbs-membership-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`ABACBS Membership [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`ABACBS Membership [Other]`)
```

COMBINE events
==============

Another multi-choice question.

```{r tidy-combine-events}
opts <- c("General programming workshops (e.g. R Python Git)",
          "Bioinformatics focused workshops (e.g. RNA-seq analysis)",
          "Professional skills workshops (e.g. presenting writing)",
          "Statistics workshops",
          "Lab skills workshops",
          "Once off seminars",
          "Regular seminar series (invited speakers)",
          "Regular seminar series (student speakers)",
          "Local social night",
          "COMBINE Symposium (annual student conference run in conjunction with the ABACBS conference)",
          "I'm not interested in events")

responses <- responses %>%
    mutate(`Future COMBINE events` = str_replace(`Future COMBINE events`,
                                                 "R, Python, Git",
                                                 "R Python Git"),
           `Future COMBINE events` = str_replace(`Future COMBINE events`,
                                                 "presenting, writing",
                                                 "presenting writing")) %>%
    add_options_cols("Future COMBINE events", opts)
```

```{r plot-combine-events}
responses %>%
    select(starts_with("Future COMBINE events [")) %>%
    select(-`Future COMBINE events [Other]`) %>%
    gather(key = Type, value = Used) %>%
    filter(Used == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(Type = str_remove(Type, "Future COMBINE events \\["),
           Type = str_remove(Type, "\\]")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

```{r combine-events-other}
responses %>%
    filter(ResearchCurrent == "Yes") %>%
    filter(`Future COMBINE events [IsOther]`) %>%
    pull(`Future COMBINE events [Other]`)
```

This other response looks like it better fits one of the other options, so I am
going to set that to TRUE instead.

```{r combine-events-set}
idx <- which(responses$`Future COMBINE events [Other]` == 
                 "Beginners guide to WGS, particularly microbial genome analysis")
responses$`Future COMBINE events [Bioinformatics focused workshops (e.g. RNA-seq analysis)]`[idx] <- TRUE
responses$`Future COMBINE events [IsOther]`[idx] <- FALSE
responses$`Future COMBINE events [Other]`[idx] <- NA
```

Session info
============

```{r session-info, cache = FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```

```{r cleanup-docs, cache = FALSE}
doc.files <- c(list.files(pattern = "pdf"),
               list.files(pattern = "html"),
               list.files(pattern = "docx"))

for (file in doc.files) {
    file.rename(file, file.path("../docs", file))
}
```
